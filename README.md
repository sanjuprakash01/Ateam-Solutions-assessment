# Ateam-Solutions-assessment
# This is a responsive web application developed by using HTML, SCSS with Bootstrap and jQuery.
# I have installed Bootstarp in the project using npm(node-package-manager) by entering the following command in terminal "npm install bootstrap@5.2.3".
# If you dont have node or npm in your system, First you have to install node in your system.
# I have compiled SCSS in to CSS by using Live SASS Compiler extension in VS Code. This helps to create a minified CSS file which will read by the web file.

# HAPPY CODING !!!
